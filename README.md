## Superposition and Entanglement Project

This project focuses on understanding the core principles of quantum computing: superposition and entanglement. Quantum circuits using Hadamard and CNOT gates are created to explore these fundamental concepts. The circuits are then run on a quantum simulator to visualize and analyze the results.

### Objectives
- Grasp the principles of superposition and entanglement.
- Observe these phenomena through practical quantum circuit simulations.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- A quantum computing environment or simulator.
- Basic knowledge of quantum mechanics and quantum circuits.

## Usage

The project includes quantum circuits and instructions for running them on a simulator. Visualize and analyze the output to observe the principles of superposition and entanglement in action.
